      <description>For many people, e-mail is taking up a significant portion of their work time. A lot of this time is spent sorting through an enormous amount of unread e-mail received every day, filtering out what needs to be read and what needs to be answered. This inevitably leads to e-mails that are not read by the end of the day. This starts a vicious circle of accumulating unread e-mails, and can end up in thousands of unread e-mails.</description>
