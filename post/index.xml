      <description>I am very excited, Fermilab just opened a PostDoc position in the CMS group. The PostDoc will have the opportunity to do cutting edge High Energy Physics (HEP) research with the CMS data at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). This is the first time that the technical part of the PostDoc position is targeted for computing topics. Please have a look at the job opening:

We are looking for excellent candidates who are about to graduate or who have graduated in HEP and who are also very interested in scientific computing.</description>
